Congratulations!  You have completed the PAN-OS Ansible lab.

What We've Accomplished
=======================

We've learned how to perform the following activities using the PAN-OS Ansible
modules:

Configuration Changes:
  The `hello_world.yml <https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/ansible-lab/blob/master/playbooks/hello_world.yml>`_
  and `full_config.yml <https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/ansible-lab/blob/master/playbooks/full_config.yml>`_
  playbooks showed how to modify the configuration of the PAN-OS device, as
  well as how to commit changes using the ``panos_commit`` module.

Operational Tasks:
  The `check_ready.yml <https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/ansible-lab/blob/master/playbooks/check_ready.yml>`_,
  the `get_facts.yml <https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/ansible-lab/blob/master/playbooks/get_facts.yml>`_,
  and the `upgrade.yml <https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/ansible-lab/blob/master/playbooks/upgrade.yml>`_
  playbooks are all examples of operational commands on a PAN-OS device.

  Operational commands are anything not configuration related.
